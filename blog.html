				<p>This website was created with the intention to be a presentable platform for my work portfolio however due to my longing to document
					my daily activities and observations, I have decided to dedicate a subsection of this website towards a blog. While I <i>could</i>
					use a more common platform such as wordpress, tumblr, or even youtube, I won't. Why? My laziness surpasses common sense. It even dares
					to allow professional and personal life to clash.</p>
				<p>Furthermore this website launched around the middle of May 2018, but this blog will only date back to the very near end of June. Why? Because
					I'm lazy? Not in this case. I wanted to contribute to the blog during the months of May and June, however I quickly ran into a problem in
					the midst of my first entry. <i>I have nothing to write.</i> What a fool I was. Like a fisherman casting his rod into his porcelain throne, I
					too have nothing to show. But alast, two months later I have arrived with a **plentiful** catch.</p>
				<p>During finals week of my spring semester of my sophomore year, my mother sent me a message asking if I wanted to come with her to Hong Kong this year.
					The last time I went was 8 years ago when I had just finished 6th grade. The time before that was when I was two and leaving my birthplace for good
					old 'murica. Since the last time, I've rejected my mother's offer every year reluctantly due to the harsh jump in schoolwork from middle school to
					Stuyvesant High School to adjusting to the college lifestyle, etc. Anyway, I decided to accept her offer since I knew I'd be busy with internships
					and job searching come the following years.</p>
				<p>Fast forward to T-minus 2 weeks before the flight, my father suddenly decides to come along with us to Hong Kong. This was a big deal to me because in my 20
					years of living, my father has never taken a break from work for longer than a weekend. The man was a workaholic. When my father wasn't working he was
					drinking, sleeping, or doing housework. Hell, when he was given an extra day off because he covered someone's shift earlier, he became sick on that day.
					So for him to come out of nowhere and essentially agree to spending an entire month doing absolutely nothing productive, I was shocked, appalled. I
					was anxious to see how he'd adjust.</p>
				<p>June 28, 2018</p>
				<p>I woke up at 10:00AM EST, slept a solid 8 hours while my mother, father and younger brother were too anxious to get a good night's rest. I acted smug about it
					to them but in reality I didn't get enough sleep the day before cause I slept over at my friend's place. We arrived at JFK at 1:20PM, an hour and a half
					early for our flight. Got through pre baggage check and TSA with no problem. With nearly an hour to spare, I sat near the gate and pondered how to solve
					one of mankinds most difficult problems: jetlag. How does one avoid it? Professional competitors are constantly traveling across the globe to participate
					in tournaments that sometimes require participants to stay warm for more than ten hours each day. The number 1 excuse used by these pros is jetlag. Try
					re-enacting evo moment #37 when your brain is thinking that it's time to knock out IRL. Since I'd be landing around 19:00 HKT, it wasn't outside the realm
					of opportunity to just have an extended 10 hour rest when I land, and that was what I decided to do.</p>
				<p>My mother decided to ride Cathay Pacific upon suggestion from my Aunt who was once a flight attendant. I personally have little to no experience with airlines,
					my only request was to avoid United Airlines due to their controversial mistreatment of their customer on United Express Flight 3411 during April 9, 2017.
					There were only a few things to note about the flight so I'll go over them quickly. 1. Sitting in the middle is not so bad. Easy access to bathroom and
					least susceptible to blinding above stratosphere sunlight. 2. Service was fantastic (at least by my standards). Attentive and often had what I wanted. Asked
					for snacks, had cup noodles and peanuts. Asked for a drink, had OJ and white wine (surprisingly). Asked for an extra blanket, got an extra blanket.
					3. Food was actually pretty good. I always had the impression that airplane food was substandard but I was proven wrong. For lunch I had braised beef with
					stir fryed potatoes, shrimp salad, a bread roll with butter, a piece of dark chocolate and haagan daz ice cream. For dinner I had sweet and sour pork over
					jasmine rice, a bread roll with butter, and mango mousse with shredded almond on top. Better than my average meal. 4. Decent selection of shows and movies.
					Watched Saving Private Ryan, Brooklyn Nine Nine, How its made, a bunch of TED talks, and best of all... BLUE PLANET II BABY. Dat's that good stuff.
					</p>
				<p>June 29, 2018</p>
				<p>In between lunch and dinner I had around 3 hours of sleep which aided in keeping me awake until I got to the apartment that my grandparents on my mother's side
					resided in. When we departed the plane, the sun was just beginning to set behind the mountains that shaped the landscape of Hong Kong and it's surrounding
					lands. This awe inspiring sight was almost enough to distract me from, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst part of Hong Kong: the climate. The moment 
					you step out of the plane, you're hit with this wave of heat and humidity that's nearly enough to make you take the next flight back to New York. It was
					33 degrees celcius, or 91 degrees fahrenheit, at 20:00. We were greeted by my grandparents who didn't look like they've aged since I last saw
					them nearly 8 years ago. Asian genes are truly amazing. After receiving all our luggage, we rushed to the nearest bus stop. The buses were similar to the
					UK's signature double deckered buses, which made sense since they used to occupy the island. We then got off the bus cause grandfather wanted to give us 
					the "Hong Kong" experience by choosing the most "traditional" place to eat which translates to poverish. The place was a real dump. I'm talking inconsistent
					seats, dirty table cloths, open kitchen with shirtless chefs and newspaper flooring, random puddle of some unidentifiable liquid, people smoking within the 
					restaurant. All the signs. When you're in Chinatown, NYC, this is actually optimal. The best places are always small, dirty and rude. The reasoning is 
					that have held themselves up through the taste of their dishes alone. The fancier looking places are tourist traps. Once you're inside, you've already done 
					screwed up. BUT the food at the place was awful and we dipped asap for our next bus. We arrived at the street of my grandparent's residence. I recognized 
					the smell in the air. It's not a smell that you can really describe to someone easily. It was simply a nostalgic smell that you can't forget. The place was
					alot smaller than I remembered-- makes sense considering I've grown much since then. I've attached a photo which gives a decent idea of the size of the
					place. This photo was taken from the front door of the apartment, so you're pretty much seeing the place like any visitor. The first room you enter is the
					living room. Then behind my uncle (the guy in the orange shirt) is a bedroom with a bunkbed and not much else cause it simply can't. On my grandmother's 
					(the person in the front) left is the kitchen, laundry room and entrance to the bathroom all bundled in one. Approximately the same size as the bedroom. 
					To the right is another bedroom and behind the fish tank is another bedroom. This is a three bedroom apartment. Really puts things in perspective.
				<p>June 30, 2018</p>
				<p>Day started at 7:00 HKT. Slept a good nine hours. I woke up feeling pretty smug.  Oh, I failed to mention that my parents and brother are sleeping in my 
					aunt's place a few train stops away. I received a message on from my mother via WeChat. Apparently she woke up at 5:00 and slept a mere four hours. How
					unfortunate :). My grandfather was already folding clothes that were left to hang outside last night. At the same time, my grandmother was doing her 
					morning prayers. She partakes in the Buddhist lifestyle. Grandfather and I left to get some breakfast at this place called Café de Coral. In the 8 years
					I was away, this fast food branch managed to expand throughout all of Hong Kong-- even nearby this apartment building which primarily houses elderly. 
					The café was located in the mini mall a few minutes away and stuck out like a sore thumb. It shared the floor with an disorganized newspaper stand, an 
					old fashioned candy shop, a dim sum restaruant, and a dollar shop. Café de Coral was very much comparable to a Western diner, except it was self served 
					and of course fast. There were a variety of options in the form of a platter. For your meat options you had the choice between honey-glazed chicken breast, 
					fried pork cutlet, sausage, ham, or salted fish. You also receive eggs (either be sunny side up or scrambled). As well as buttered toast or a softer bun-like
					loaf. For a mere 5 extra HKD (or 64 cents), you can add a bowl of noodle soup-- also with a huge number of options. I personally prefer the oxtail soup
					with macaroni. And finally for the drinks, you have the option between milk tea, hot tea, and coffee. All of this for under 5 USD. No wonder it has taken 
					the island by storm. If the US had this, McDonalds would have a run for it's money. Because of it's location, this Café de Coral attracted an army of 
					elderly people including my grandfather. After we finished our feast, we chatted for a while. It's difficult talking to someone when your common language 
					with them is both your secondary language. My grandfather mostly speaks Cantonese and my secondary language is Fuzhounese. It works out. Although I'm 
					pretty sure I accidentally said yes to him asking me if I was going to move to Hong Kong. Later on my uncle took myself and my brother to the Hong Kong 
					Museum of Coastal Defence. It was fairly small compared to the museums in NYC but being located on the very site the events documented took place gave it 
					an authentic feel. There was a floor dedicated to all the events that took place on the coast such as the opium war where the Europeans succeeded in 
					getting the locals addicted on opium and all the way up to the British giving Hong Kong back to China in 1997. I have to thank the British for making 
					Hong Kong very accessible to English speakers because I can't speak a single word of Cantonese. I've attached a few pictures featuring some weapons. 
					At night, the whole family got together to eat dinner at the dim sum place I briefly mentioned earlier. 8 years does a lot to a family. Since then, four 
					new members of the family have popped up. I've attached a photo for visuals. From left to right, the new members are Wise, Amber, Jasper, and Kayden. 
					Wise(6) is a little rascal and is the noisiest of the bunch. Amber(3) loves to silently avoid eating. Jasper(3) loves attention. And finally Kayden. No 
					offense to the others, but Kayden is my favorite. Surprisingly, Kayden is also 6. He looks like he's 3 but he's just tiny. Even so, he's incredibly smart 
					and well mannered for a 6 year old. He's decently fluent in both Cantonese and English and when he doesn't know a word, he'll ask for the definition. Hell, 
					my brother is 12 years old and Kayden seems way more knowledgeable and well mannered than him. I'm also not totally being biased cause he warmed up to me 
					immediately and not because I brought my nintendo switch or whatever. I've always been against having kids but if I did have one, I hope that kid is like 
					Kayden.</p>
				<p>July 1, 2018</p>
				<p>Woke up at 7:00 HKT again. Cafe de Coral again. I might be getting to used to this. Keeping track of my weight might be a wise idea. Today I made an attempt at 
					reading the local newspaper. The only headline I recognized was July 1, 1997, the day the British gave back Hong Kong to China. Had I'd been born ten months 
					earlier I'd be a legal British resident. This entire weekend was a national holiday so the whole family was free to have some lunch at this extra fancy dim 
					sum place near Tseung Kwan station. Only thing worth noting was the Kayden was disappointed that I didn't bring my Nintendo Switch which made me sad. 
					We (myself, brother, and two cousins) left early and headed for the Golden Computer Arcade located near Tsuen Wan station. This place... is amazing. I 
					wasn't able to stay for long because my brother hated the crowded area, but I'll definitely go again soon. It's the techie heaven. Cheap and competitive 
					prices for all your PC and gaming needs. Tech heaven on Earth. Maybe I'm over exaggerating, but that's only because NYC is plagued with shitty Best Buys 
					and Game Stops that are allowed to charge extra on everything. I'll have more to say the next time I go because this is worth an entire day's post. </p>
				<p>July 2, 2018</p>
				<p>Woke up at 8:00 HKT. Cafe de Coral. Used to this. Weight oopsie. Today we went to the beach. I personally don't care for the beach but my brother wanted to show 
					off that he could swim. There's not much opportunity to learn how to swim in NYC. Closest free option is Coney Island which is two hours away by the MTA. 
					My brother was lucky enough to receive swimming lessons. Not jealous at all :|. Besides I don't like getting wet cause my hair is very voluminous. I'm not 
					exaggerating when I say that I look like a wet poodle in the water. While my brother, uncle and cousin froliced in the cold fish piss plastic filled dump 
					we call the ocean. I walked along the coast looking for anything interesting. Surprise! I found nothing of interest. Blue Planet II has spoiled me greatly. 
					There's a reason 5 hours of presentable footage took 16 years to collect. All I learned was that sandy water feels as course as it sounds and to no one's 
					surprise, attractive people don't go to the beach. At the very least, burying my brother and giving him breasts was entertaining enough to make the 
					trip worthwhile. This day was pretty hectic. We had to leave the beach in a rush because my aunt failed to mention that we were meeting with the rest of 
					the family at some fancy restaurant for my father's birthday. So we quickly went back to the house, cleansed ourselves, dressed up and left again. Honestly 
					this entire week has been hectic as hell with no free time to myself which is why this entire week has been bunched up into one post. It turned out that 
					this fancy restaurant was extra fancy for the reason that every dish was vegetarian so even my Buddhist grandmother could enjoy herself. And by god, the 
					food was incredible. There were these skewers and sweet and sour chicken that tasted like chicken but wasn't chicken. Fish cakes without fish that tasted 
					even better than fish. Cantonese pancakes with the right amount of crispiness. Meatloaf with no meat. Vegetarian stuffing with lettuce wrap and an 
					accompanying sauce. Donuts with heated frosting on the side. Okay that's not really impressive but it was really tasty. All these pseudo meats were imitated 
					using a certain ratio of flour and mushroom which both can produce a lot of unique flavors when combined with certain sauce and spices. Honestly this meal 
					almost convinced me to become a vegetarian. For that night, my brother and I agreed to switch sleeping arrangements. I would be sleeping at my aunt's 
					which was apparently a "high class" residence area. Honestly, I wasn't ready to learn what that meant. In order to enter the residence area, you needed to 
					use a special octopus card. I haven't explained what an octopus card is so I'll explain briefly. An octopus card is a contactless smart card that has 
					many functions including online and offline electronic payments, public transportation, parking meters, library card fees, school attendance, and even as 
					a keycard to access residential areas. This card pretty much did everything, thus losing such a card meant heavy consequences. My aunt's card gained her 
					entrance to the building. Classifying the residence as "high class" was quite literal. It was over 57 stories tall and my aunt lived on the 50th floor. Her 
		[			apartment was still small like any other place except everything about it screamed expensive. The floor, couch and door was white and pristine. The bathroom 
					and TV were state of the art. Kitchen with the latest applicances. If it weren't for the toys on the floor, this apartment would be on the cover of Better 
					Homes magazine. However the most startling aspect of the home was the unexpected resident. A Filipino "domestic worker" named Grace. My Aunt and Uncle owned 
					a slave. You might think I'm exaggerating but everything about it was just wrong. Grace's clothes were cheap looking. Her bed was just an elevated extended 
					window sill and a thin blanket. She wasn't exactly treated super highly by my Aunt and Uncle. Even Kayden seemed to treat her differently. Thinking about 
					the scenario made me restless that night and I realized that living in such a scene didn't suit me right.</p>
