						<h2>Stuyvesant High School</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							I obtained my Advanced Regents Diploma for Stuyvesant High School in 2016. Stuyvesant is labeled as the best public high school in New York City and is regularly regarded as one of the best public schools within the country according to various credible magazines and articles.
							This is due to Stuyvesant's highly competitive entrance exam that accepts roughly a mere 800 students out of 30,000 test takers annually. These naturally talented students are supported by the school's rigorous standards for their students and staff.
							In fact, it was due to one teacher's determination that I was even introduced to Computer Science. Stuyvesant's CS department only exists because of Mike Zamansky's persistence to create a successfuly CS high school program.
							Since then my passion for Computer Science has only grown. 
						</p>
						<h2>Stony Brook University</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							Stony Brook University's Computer Science program is consistently rated as top 40 in the US annually.
							This is not a surprise considering SBU's long list of prestigious alumni and professors.
							I came to this university after some receiving guidance from my high school computer science teacher who happened to be an alumni there. 
							Since then it has been two years and I am forever grateful to him.
							My major is Computer Science and I boast a 3.6 GPA.

						<h2>Handball</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							Before you start to wonder, no it is not the team handball they play in Europe.
							The handball I play involves the players using their hands to hit a small rubber ball against a wall such that their opponent cannot do the same without it touching the ground twice.
							The game is very similar to squash except the skill floor is much harsher simply due to fact that your reach and coverage isn't as lenient as in squash.
							This leads to the obvious question. Why play handball over squash? Unlike sports such as golf, tennis, baseball, etc, handball only requires a single rubber ball that can be purchased for a buck and a local park. 
							As a bored child that grew up without much money, I couldn't really even afford to risk losing the expensive equipment other sports needed. So I was kinda stuck playing handball. I'm sure that many other kids were also the same way.
							Since then I've been playing handball for over eight years.
						</p>
						<h2>Ping Pong</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							I was inspired to pick up ping pong after watching the show Ping Pong the Animation (fantastic show by the way, you can probably binge it in a single weekend).
							I haven't played nearly as much ping pong as handball, but after being in Hong Kong for a month I can say that I have enough skill to take on those with far more experience than I.
						</p>
						<h2>Marathon Running</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							I actually took up jogging to improve my endurance for handball but since taking it up in 2015, I regularly take a jog at the gym when the weather is too poor for handball.
							My fastest mile was done in 7 minutes 14 seconds.
							The longest distance I've ran in half an hour is 3.8 miles.
						</p>

					<button class="accordion"> Gaming </button>
					<div class="panel" id="override-panel-3">
						<h2>Classic Gaming</h2>
						<p id="override-p">
							While I am PC master race, I grew up with a Nintendo DS and have been loyal to Nintendo since childhood.
							Gaming has grown a huge presence within the past decade due to competitive games such as Fortnite and League of Legends.
							However my forte are single player games and fighting games. In fact, in high school I was vice president of the Super Smash Bros Club.
							These days it has become more and more difficult to find any self regarded "gamers" that can name a single player game they played recently so if you indulge in single player games, we'll definitely be able to bond over that.

							<h2>Travelling</h2>
							<p id="override-p">
								Last summer, I travelled to Hong Kong and Japan for a month and since then have decided I would love to travel all over the world.
								Before travelling out of the country, I thought that travelling was boring because I lived in NYC and had the impression that every city was the same and felt that nice views were not for me.
								I couldn't have been more wrong. For anyone skeptical of traveling, you should check out my blog for more info on Hong Kong. I will update my blog regarding my travels in Japan when I'm free.
