				<p>This website was created with the intention to be a presentable platform for my work portfolio however due to my longing to document
					my daily activities and observations, I have decided to dedicate a subsection of this website towards a blog. While I <i>could</i>
					use a more common platform such as wordpress, tumblr, or even youtube, I won't. Why? My laziness surpasses common sense. It even dares
					to allow professional and personal life to clash.</p>
				<p>Furthermore this website launched around the middle of May 2018, but this blog will only date back to the very near end of June. Why? Because
					I'm lazy? Not in this case. I wanted to contribute to the blog during the months of May and June, however I quickly ran into a problem in
					the midst of my first entry. <i>I have nothing to write.</i> What a fool I was. Like a fisherman casting his rod into his porcelain throne, I
					too have nothing to show. But alast, two months later I have arrived with a **plentiful** catch.</p>
				<p>During finals week of my spring semester of my sophomore year, my mother sent me a message asking if I wanted to come with her to Hong Kong this year.
					The last time I went was 8 years ago when I had just finished 6th grade. The time before that was when I was two and leaving my birthplace for good
					old 'murica. Since the last time, I've rejected my mother's offer every year reluctantly due to the harsh jump in schoolwork from middle school to
					Stuyvesant High School to adjusting to the college lifestyle, etc. Anyway, I decided to accept her offer since I knew I'd be busy with internships
					and job searching come the following years.</p>
				<p>Fast forward to T-minus 2 weeks before the flight, my father suddenly decides to come along with us to Hong Kong. This was a big deal to me because in my 20
					years of living, my father has never taken a break from work for longer than a weekend. The man was a workaholic. When my father wasn't working he was
					drinking, sleeping, or doing housework. Hell, when he was given an extra day off because he covered someone's shift earlier, he became sick on that day.
					So for him to come out of nowhere and essentially agree to spending an entire month doing absolutely nothing productive, I was shocked, appalled. I
					was anxious to see how he'd adjust.</p>
				<p>June 28, 2018</p>
				<p>I woke up at 10:00AM EST, slept a solid 8 hours while my mother, father and younger brother were too anxious to get a good night's rest. I acted smug about it
					to them but in reality I didn't get enough sleep the day before cause I slept over at my friend's place. We arrived at JFK at 1:20PM, an hour and a half
					early for our flight. Got through pre baggage check and TSA with no problem. With nearly an hour to spare, I sat near the gate and pondered how to solve
					one of mankinds most difficult problems: jetlag. How does one avoid it? Professional competitors are constantly traveling across the globe to participate
					in tournaments that sometimes require participants to stay warm for more than ten hours each day. The number 1 excuse used by these pros is jetlag. Try
					re-enacting evo moment #37 when your brain is thinking that it's time to knock out IRL. Since I'd be landing around 19:00 HKT, it wasn't outside the realm
					of opportunity to just have an extended 10 hour rest when I land, and that was what I decided to do.</p>
				<p>My mother decided to ride Cathay Pacific upon suggestion from my Aunt who was once a flight attendant. I personally have little to no experience with airlines,
					my only request was to avoid United Airlines due to their controversial mistreatment of their customer on United Express Flight 3411 during April 9, 2017.
					There were only a few things to note about the flight so I'll go over them quickly. 1. Sitting in the middle is not so bad. Easy access to bathroom and
					least susceptible to blinding above stratosphere sunlight. 2. Service was fantastic (at least by my standards). Attentive and often had what I wanted. Asked
					for snacks, had cup noodles and peanuts. Asked for a drink, had OJ and white wine (surprisingly). Asked for an extra blanket, got an extra blanket.
					3. Food was actually pretty good. I always had the impression that airplane food was substandard but I was proven wrong. For lunch I had braised beef with
					stir fryed potatoes, shrimp salad, a bread roll with butter, a piece of dark chocolate and haagan daz ice cream. For dinner I had sweet and sour pork over
					jasmine rice, a bread roll with butter, and mango mousse with shredded almond on top. Better than my average meal. 4. Decent selection of shows and movies.
					Watched Saving Private Ryan, Brooklyn Nine Nine, How its made, a bunch of TED talks, and best of all... BLUE PLANET II BABY. Dat's that good stuff.

				<p>June 29, 2018</p>
				<p>In between lunch and dinner I had around 3 hours of sleep which aided in keeping me awake until I got to the apartment that my grandparents on my mother's side
					resided in. When we departed the plane, the sun was just beginning to set behind the mountains that shaped the landscape of Hong Kong and it's surrounding
					lands. This awe inspiring sight was almost enough to distract me from, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst part of Hong Kong: the climate. The moment 
					you step out of the plane, you're hit with this wave of heat and humidity that's nearly enough to make you take the next flight back to New York. It was
					33 degrees celcius, or 91 degrees fahrenheit, at 20:00. However, we were also greeted by my grandparents who didn't look like they've aged since I last saw
					them nearly 8 years ago. Asian genes are truly amazing. After receiving all our luggage, we rushed to the nearest bus stop. Hong Kong's buses were clearly
					designed based off the United Kingdom's with their double deckered structure. We got off the bus to transfer to another route but decided to stop by
					somewhere to eat. My grandfather wanted to give us the "Hong Kong" experience by choosing the most "traditional" place to eat which translates to poverish. 
					The place was a real dump. I'm talking inconsistent seats, dirty table cloths, open kitchen with shirtless chefs and newspaper flooring, random puddle of 
					some unidentifiable liquid, people smoking within the restaurant. All the signs. When you're in Chinatown, NYC, this is actually the correct way to find a
					place to eat. The best places are always small, dirty and rude. The reasoning is that these places have been here for decades and have held themselves up 
					through the taste of their dishes alone. The fancy looking restaruants are tourist traps. Once you're inside, you've already done screwed up. Needless to
					say the food at the place was awful and we quickly left for the next bus. When we arrived, I recognized the smell in the air. It's not a smell that you can
					really describe like an apple pie or a fresh batch of laundry. It was simply a nostalgic smell that you can't forget. It had been 8 years and my nose did 
					not forget what my old home smelled like.
